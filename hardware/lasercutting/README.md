# Laser Cutting
1. In comparison to 3D Printing (scad and exported stl files in the repository), laser cutting is much faster.
2. Software access off campus or on a laptop: myapps-> app stream-> Adobe Illustrator
3. Use Adobe Illustrator to create a .ai file and add that plus the associated exported pdf file to the repository.
- Red for inside cuts, green for outside cuts, blue for vector engrave, black for raster etch.
- Get your design cut at [The Built Environment Labs - N114A Laser Cutting Lab](https://designandbuiltlabs.simplybook.me/v2/#book/category/2/service/11/count/1/) Tuesdays 9-3, other weekdays 8-4. Email your .ai design to fastlasercutter@humber.ca and ask them to please cut it out of clear 3mm acrylic letting them know to please give you at least 8 of the donut/spacers. Pick it up 4 days after submitting it or sooner.
