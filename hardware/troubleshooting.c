/*  C code to read whoami registers from say the
 *  Raspberry Pi Sense HAT add-on board (HTS221 sensor)
 *  Inspired by: https://github.com/davebm1/c-sense-hat/blob/main/humidity.c
 *  Referenced: https://www.includehelp.com/c/working-with-hexadecimal-values-in-c-programming-language.aspx
 *  Note that from: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UM10204.pdf
 *  "The Device ID Read can be done, starting with the 12 manufacturer bits (first byte +
 *   four MSBs of the second byte), followed by the nine part identification bits (four LSBs
 *   of the second byte + five MSBs of the third byte), and then the three die revision bits
 *   (three LSBs of the third byte)."
 *  Though I don't see it documented "0xFFFFFF87" seems to represent "register not found"
 *  sudo raspi-config --> interfacing options --> enable i2c
 *  sudo apt install libi2c-dev
 *  Build with:  gcc -Wall -O2 troubleshooting.c -o troubleshooting -li2c
